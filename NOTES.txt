automake and libtool research for sigrok bug #1433
partial linking to create a NULL terminated list of drivers
which were built into the library

inspired by https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=802
and https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1433,
reported for LTO but probably of more general nature
(just noticed with recent LTO setups)

given constraints:
- driver source code provided "driver code" (regular application)
  as well as "list item" (one pointer to the driver's description)
- driver pointer is put into a separate segment during compilation,
  needs to get collected to a list of drivers with NULL termination
  at compile time, ideally before application code uses the library
- existing build support for the libsigrok library puts all drivers
  into the src/libdrivers.la library, iteration over the driver list
  is fortunately concentrated in a src/drivers.c source file

envisioned approach:
- use a linker script to convert the src/drivers.lo iteration logic
  plus the src/libdrivers.la code base into a src/libdrivers_list.la
  library that applications can "juse use"
